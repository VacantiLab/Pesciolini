Directions for building and uploading a pip package:
https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/


Commands needed after setuptools and wheel are upgraded:

python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*


Logging into TestPyPi:
username: __token__

Whatever your token is


Installing the package:
python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps PolyMID==0.0.5

This one works with specifying the version:
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ PolyMID==0.0.5

Note: Including .txt files in the distribution was difficult. Directions that work are here:
