Directions for building and uploading a pip package:
https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/


Commands needed after setuptools and wheel are upgraded:

Create the package contents
python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

Upload
Practice pypi:
python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

Real pypi:
python3 -m twine upload dist/*


Logging into TestPyPi:
username: __token__

Whatever your token is (created in the settings menu of your pipy account)


Installing the package:
python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps PolyMID==1.0.0

This one works with specifying the version:
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ PolyMID==1.0.0

Note: Including .txt files in the distribution was difficult. Directions that work are here:

See the line in the setup.py file that is in the PolyMID package folder in the Dropbox folder for PolyMID.
    There is a line in the file: package_data={'': ['*.txt']} that takes care of uploading text files
