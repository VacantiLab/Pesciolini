To do:
- In the formula class, work on the method calc_natural
x    Allow chemical formulas to be entered without 1s by insert the 1s into a formula if they are absent.
x    I don't like the specification of n_rel_abun. Get rid of this by storing atom MIDs in a dictionary.
x    Why are the entries in the atom_abundances dictionary pandas.Series instead of np.arrays?
x        Do not need to be, changed them to np.arrays.
-    Make the atoms MIDs an attribute of an object that can be changed
x In the expand_polynomial function, shorten factored_aggregated in a way that considers the resulting MID values
x In the fragment class, work on create_correction_matrix
x     make the MIDs the same length by adding zeros to make all of them the same length as the longest MID in the correction matrix
x     instead of having a 'MetaboliteAtoms' attribute, have a 'CanAcquireLabel' attribute
x         I think it will be used identically, so just renaming an attribute of the Fragment class to be more reflective of what it is
-     In the fragment class make CM a dictionary with entries for C, H, N, and O.
-         make a way to specify this in the text file
- Call the software package PolyMID
-     Two functions should be PolyMID.correct() and PolyMID.natural()
- Have options for high resolution data
- Have an option to correct for incorporation of specific atoms (H, C, N, etc.)
