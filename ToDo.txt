To do:
- In the formula class, work on the method calc_natural
x    Allow chemical formulas to be entered without 1s by insert the 1s into a formula if they are absent.
x    I don't like the specification of n_rel_abun. Get rid of this by storing atom MIDs in a dictionary.
-    Why are the entries in the atom_abundances dictionary pandas.Series instead of np.arrays?
-        Make them np.arrays if that makes sense. Likely has to do with expand_polynomial() function.
-    Make the atoms MIDs an attribute of an object that can be changed
- In the fragment class, work on create_correction_matrix
