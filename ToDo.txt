To do:
x In the formula class, work on the method calc_natural
x    Allow chemical formulas to be entered without 1s by insert the 1s into a formula if they are absent.
x    I don't like the specification of n_rel_abun. Get rid of this by storing atom MIDs in a dictionary.
x    Why are the entries in the atom_abundances dictionary pandas.Series instead of np.arrays?
x        Do not need to be, changed them to np.arrays.
- In the expand_polynomial function, shorten factored_aggregated in a way that considers the molecular formula and # of Hv atoms
-    Make the atoms MIDs an attribute of an object that can be changed
- In the fragment class, work on create_correction_matrix
